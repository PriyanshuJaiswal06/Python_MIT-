 # Part A: Saving for a House
#You have just graduated from MIT and have a job! You move to the Bay Area and decide that you want to start saving for a home. 
#Houses are fairly expensive, so you start saving up for the down payment on your dream home

#Your goal is to find "the number of months it takes to save up for a down payment". 
#The cost of your down payment is calculated by multiplying the total cost of your dream house by the down payment percentage.
# User Inputs.
# Ask the user to enter the following variables and cast them as floats. They must be initialized in the following order at the beginning of
# your program, before declaring other variables.
# 1. The starting yearly salary (yearly_salary)
# 2. The portion of salary to be saved (portion_saved). This variable should be in decimal form (e.g. 0.1 for 10%).
# 3. The cost of your dream home (cost_of_dream_home)

# Writing the Program. You will need to determine how many months it will take given the following information:
#     1. yearly_salary, as described above.     
#     2. portion_saved, as described above.
#     3. cost_of_dream_home, as described above.
#     4. portion_down_payment, the percentage of the total cost needed for a down payment. Assume portion_down_payment = 0.25(25%)
#     5. The amount that you have saved thus far is amount_saved, which starts at $0.
#     6. You get an annual rate of return r. In other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional amount_saved * (r/12) funds for your savings (the 12 is because r is an annual rate). Assume r = 0.05 (5%).
#     7.  At the end of each month, your savings increase by (1) a percentage of your monthly salary and (2) the monthly return on your investment. 
#     (Note:The investment amount used to calculate the monthly return is the amount you had saved at the start of each month.)
# Output.
#  . Your program should store the number of months required to save for the down payment using a variable called months.

# Notes
# Be careful about values that represent annual amounts versus monthly amounts.
# If the number of months your program returns is off by one, reread the highlighted text above.
# Assume that users enter valid inputs (e.g. no string inputs when expecting a float).
# Your program should print outputs in the same format as the test cases below. If you're using Spyder, you might see extra lines in between
# outputs. Don't worry about them!
